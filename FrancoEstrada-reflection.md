#Reflect
* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I was struggling with merge.
* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
Merge was clarified. 
* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
How to merge. When should I use pull and when should I use fetch. 
* **What still confuses you about Git?**
Why are branches not shared when we either pull or fetch. Is there a way to delete remote branches from local git? What kind of information should my commit messages have?
* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
It was pretty good. I love the disposition of my pair, and the clarity of my guide when we needed explanations.
