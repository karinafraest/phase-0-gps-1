* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Prior to the GPS session, I don't think I was necessarily struggling with any particular concept. I just need to keep practicing and get used to pulling and pushing with a partner.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Working with a partner definitely helped clarify the Git/GitHub process. Again, it's something that I just need to keep practicing.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I needed reminders on some of the git and branch commands on the second day that we worked together. As for the guide, I remember asking for a clarification on on commit messages.

* What still confuses you about Git?

Nothing really confuses me about Git. I think I just need to remember to constantly check my statuses and to add and commit.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

My partner was really nice and I think she really had a good understanding of the concepts. I really enjoyed it!!
